Hello, friend! This is a document intended for someone to gauge whether or not they are contributing in a proper way to the emotional labor of their life. This applies to things you do by yourself, with friends acquaintances, with your partner, with your children, and at work. There are a few sections of organization, to emphasize related aspects of emotional labor.

Some of these questions may not seem like they relate to emotional labor. For example, keeping your home clean is not emotional labor. Nonetheless, if you don't do it, you can create emotional labor for the other people in your life, especially your partner--they may worry about how you will be seen by their friends, and how they may be judged for allowing you to live in a dirty house. Therefore, you ought to keep your house clean to spare your partner the burden of that emotional labor.

This list was initially sparked by a [Metafilter discussion](http://www.metafilter.com/151267/Wheres-My-Cut-On-Unpaid-Emotional-Labor) on Jess Zimmerman's article for The Toast, _[“Where’s My Cut?”: On Unpaid Emotional Labor](http://the-toast.net/2015/07/13/emotional-labor/view-all/)_. Commenters on an [Ask Metafilter thread](http://ask.metafilter.com/283189/Emotional-Labor-Checklist-Self-Assessment) helped to refine and vastly expand this checklist. Many thanks to all those contributors, and thanks in advance to anyone who helps with this list!

If you are a man who has unusual difficulty with emotional labor due to experiencing oppressions like economic instability, disability or mental illness, see the [Intersections](#appendix-intersections) section for some ways to apply this checklist to understanding the gendered nature of emotional work.

# Appendix: Intersections

If you are a man who has difficulty with emotional labor due to experiencing oppressions like economic instability, disability or mental illness, you may have read this list and thought "some of the things on this list are hard or impossible for me to do" due to class background, economic instability, disability, mental illness, neuroatypicality and many other oppressions. However, here are some thought experiments to explore if you are a man and you have this reaction:

* Do I need to perform similar amounts of emotional labor to a woman who shares my class background, economic instability or other oppressions?
* Do I feel the same requirement as a woman who shares my class background, economic instability or other oppressions to perform not only all this, but _additional_ emotional labor in order to reduce the impact of my class background, economic instability or other oppressions on other people?
* Do I feel a requirement to perform not only all this, but _additional_ emotional labor in order to still see my self and be seen as a man despite my class background, economic instability or other oppressions?
* When I am unable to perform some of the emotional labor needed in my life, am I punished nearly as much as a woman who shares my class background, economic instability or other oppressions?
* When I am unable to perform some of the emotional labor needed in my life, am I taught to punish myself nearly as much as a woman who shares my class background, economic instability or other oppressions?
* Do people give women who share my class background, economic instability or other oppressions the same assistance I get with emotional labor?
